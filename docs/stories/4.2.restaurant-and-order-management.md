# Story 4.2: Restaurant and Order Management

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** administrator,
**I want** to manage restaurant profiles and view active/completed orders,
**so that** I can ensure smooth operations and provide support when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Admins can view a list of all registered restaurants with status (active, paused, pending verification).
2. Admins can view and edit key restaurant fields (name, address, contact, open status) with audit trail.
3. Admins can browse and filter orders by status and date range and open details for any order.
4. Access restricted to authenticated admins only.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Access control (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Restrict routes/actions by admin role
- [ ] Restaurant management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] List/search restaurants; show status
  - [ ] Edit profile fields with confirmation and audit entry
- [ ] Order list and detail (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Filter by status/date; paginate
  - [ ] View details: items, client, restaurant, delivery partner, timeline

## Dev Notes

- Source reference: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` (RBAC, data access, orders model)
- Keep operations safe-by-default: confirmations for edits; display read-only sensitive fields.
- Define `RestaurantAdminService` and `OrderAdminService` interfaces.

### Testing

- Verify only admins can access.
- Edit flows record audit entries.
- Order list filters and details render as expected.
