# Story 4.3: Data Collection Foundations for Analytics/AI

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to ensure key platform data is collected and stored in a structured way,
**so that** future analytics and AI insights are possible without rework.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Events and entities captured: orders (lifecycle), user interactions (chat intents, key actions), delivery timings, and error events.
2. Data model defined for analytics store (tables/collections with schema and retention policies).
3. Ingestion path is resilient and does not degrade real-time user flows (async/batch-friendly).
4. Access controls in place; PII minimized and protected; secrets via environment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define analytics schemas (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Orders lifecycle events (created, accepted, preparing, ready, dispatched, delivered, canceled)
  - [ ] Interaction events (intent name, confidence, action taken, anonymized user id)
  - [ ] Delivery telemetry (timestamps for pickup, depart, arrive)
  - [ ] Error/exception events
- [ ] Instrumentation points (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Emit events from API/services (non-blocking)
  - [ ] Buffer/queue for ingestion (stub adapter if pipeline not ready)
- [ ] Storage + retention (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Define storage destination and partitioning (by date/order id)
  - [ ] Set retention windows and purge policy
- [ ] Security & privacy (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Avoid raw PII where possible; use hashed/anonymized identifiers
  - [ ] RBAC for analytics access

## Dev Notes

- Source reference: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` (eventing, storage), `docs/epics/epic-4-admin-dashboard-analytics.md`.
- Define `AnalyticsEventBus` and `AnalyticsRepository` interfaces to abstract providers.
- Ensure idempotency on event writes (dedupe by event id) and backpressure handling.

### Testing

- Emit simulated events from key flows; verify ingestion and schema validation.
- Load tests to confirm minimal impact on live flows.
- Access tests for RBAC and PII protections.
