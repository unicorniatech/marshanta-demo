# Story 1.2: User Authentication & Authorization

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** client,
**I want** to securely register, log in, and log out of the platform,
**so that** my personal data and order history are protected.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A registration endpoint is available for new users.
2. A login endpoint authenticates users and returns a session token.
3. All requests to protected endpoints require a valid session token.
4. User data is stored securely in the database.
5. A logout endpoint or flow invalidates the active session/token.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement auth data model wiring (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Prepare `User` table fields needed for auth (email, password hash, role, createdAt, updatedAt) (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Choose secure password hashing (per architecture guidance; placeholder in this story if unspecified) (AC: 4)
- [ ] Registration endpoint (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Endpoint: `POST /auth/register` accepts email/password
  - [ ] Validate inputs and enforce uniqueness of email
  - [ ] Store password as hash only; never store plaintext
  - [ ] Return success with minimal user profile
- [ ] Login endpoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Endpoint: `POST /auth/login` accepts email/password
  - [ ] Verify credentials against stored hash
  - [ ] Issue session token (JWT or session per architecture; placeholder here) with role claim
  - [ ] Return token and minimal profile
- [ ] Logout endpoint (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Endpoint: `POST /auth/logout` (or token revocation)
  - [ ] Invalidate session/token (revocation list or session store)
  - [ ] Return success; client clears local session
- [ ] Auth middleware/guard (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify token on protected routes
  - [ ] Attach user context to request
  - [ ] Handle expired/invalid tokens consistently
- [ ] Security hardening (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Rate-limit login/register
  - [ ] Input validation & error handling patterns
  - [ ] Secrets management via env vars; no secrets in source control

## Dev Notes

 - Source reference: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` (PWA + serverless, API Gateway, RESTful endpoints). Token strategy to be finalized by architecture story; for now, keep abstraction friendly to serverless handlers.
- Keep implementation minimal and secure. Use environment variables for secrets. Do not pick specific libraries not defined by architecture yet; stub interfaces if necessary.
- Ensure endpoints designed to live under API Gateway pathing used by apps.

### Testing

- Unit tests for hashing/verification and middleware behavior.
- Positive/negative tests for registration/login, including duplicate email and wrong password.
- Middleware tests for protected route access with/without valid token.
- Logout flow: after logout, protected route access fails until re-login.
