# Story 2.2: Menu Browsing & Order Creation (Conversational)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** client,
**I want** to ask Marshanta for menus from local restaurants and add items conversationally,
**so that** I can create an order without navigating complex menus.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Natural language queries like "Show me menus" or "What's on the menu at [Restaurant]?" are supported.
2. Clients can add items and quantities via chat (e.g., "Add 2 tacos al pastor").
3. The AI confirms an order summary with line items, taxes/fees, and total before placement.
4. Users can edit the cart via chat (remove item, change quantity) prior to confirm.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Menu query understanding (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Intent/slot mapping for menu discovery and item selection
  - [ ] Query restaurants by name/category/location
- [ ] Cart operations via chat (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Add/remove/change quantity intents
  - [ ] Persist cart in session for authenticated users
- [ ] Order summary & confirmation (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Generate readable summary with items, taxes/fees, total
  - [ ] Confirm/Cancel prompts; proceed only on explicit confirm
- [ ] Data/API integration
  - [ ] Read menus from `Restaurant`/Menu endpoints (stub if not yet implemented)
  - [ ] Create order draft resource prior to payment

## Dev Notes

- Source reference:
  - `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` (API layers, data models, Orders flow)
  - `docs/front-end-spec/introduction.md` and `docs/front-end-spec/information-architecture-ia.md` (conversational UX)
- Keep responses concise and actionable; confirm ambiguities (sizes, modifiers) with follow-ups.
- Do not choose an NLU library here; define handler interfaces for intents/slots.

### Testing

- Conversational flows: add/edit cart, ambiguous item disambiguation, summary confirm/cancel.
- Data integration: menu retrieval happy/edge paths; cart persistence.
