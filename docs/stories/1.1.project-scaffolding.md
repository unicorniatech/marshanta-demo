# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the project's monorepo structure and install all core dependencies,
**so that** I have a consistent and organized starting point for development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project root contains a `package.json` file with monorepo configurations.
2. The `apps` directory contains `web` (PWA) and `api` (backend) folders.
3. A `packages/shared` folder exists for shared code.
4. All core dependencies are installed in their respective `package.json` files.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create monorepo root scaffolding (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add root `package.json` with workspaces set to `apps/*` and `packages/*` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `.editorconfig` (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create directory structure (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `apps/web/` for the PWA frontend (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `apps/api/` for serverless/backend functions (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `packages/shared/` for shared types/utils/components (AC: 3)
- [ ] Initialize app package manifests (AC: 4)
  - [ ] `apps/web/package.json` (AC: 4)
  - [ ] `apps/api/package.json` (AC: 4)
  - [ ] `packages/shared/package.json` (AC: 4)
- [ ] Align structure with Fullstack Architecture document (AC: 1-3)
  - [ ] Verify folders match `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` unified project structure
- [ ] Install dependencies (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Install minimal, placeholder dependencies per package (no tech decisions beyond docs)
  - [ ] Run install to ensure workspace linking succeeds

## Dev Notes

 - Source reference: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` â†’ Unified Project Structure shows target layout:
  - Root: `.github/workflows/`, `apps/` (`web/`, `api/`, `restaurant-app/`, `delivery-app/`), `packages/shared/`, `infrastructure/`, `docs/`, `.env.example`, `README.md`.
- Scope for this story: only create `apps/web/`, `apps/api/`, and `packages/shared/` plus root workspaces and basic scaffolding. Additional apps and infra will be added in later stories.
- Do not choose specific frameworks or libs not specified in docs. Keep `package.json` minimal and ready to extend in subsequent stories.
- After install, verify workspace resolution and that each package has its own manifest.

### Testing

- Architecture docs do not yet specify testing standards. No testing framework selection in this story.
- Validation for this story is by structure and successful workspace install (e.g., `npm install` completes without workspace errors).
- Explicit verification steps:
   - Confirm root `package.json` includes workspaces: `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
   - Confirm directories exist: `apps/web/`, `apps/api/`, `packages/shared/`.
   - Confirm manifests exist: `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/api/package.json`, `packages/shared/package.json`.
   - Run dependency install and verify no workspace linking errors.
