# Story 2.1: Client Onboarding (PWA + Intro Chat)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** new client,
**I want** to access the Marshanta PWA, register/login, and receive a short guided intro in chat,
**so that** I can quickly start using the service.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The PWA is installable on mobile (meets baseline PWA criteria: manifest, service worker, HTTPS context).
2. First-time visitors see a welcome message from Marshanta AI with a brief "how to order" guide.
3. Users can register and log in from within the conversational UI.
4. Returning users are recognized and greeted by name in the chat.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] PWA bootstrap (AC: 1)
  - [ ] App manifest with name, icons, start URL, display mode
  - [ ] Service worker scaffold with basic caching strategy
  - [ ] Verify install prompt on supported mobile browsers
- [ ] Welcome flow (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Detect first-time vs returning session
  - [ ] Render AI welcome + short ordering instructions
- [ ] Auth onboarding within chat (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Chat prompts to register/login
  - [ ] Hand off to auth endpoints from Story 1.2
  - [ ] On success, store session and greet user by name on return

## Dev Notes

- Source reference:
  - `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` (PWA architecture, auth integration)
  - `docs/front-end-spec/introduction.md` (UX goals), `docs/front-end-spec/information-architecture-ia.md` (IA)
- Keep UI minimal and conversational; avoid heavy UI scaffolding beyond PWA baseline.
- Respect auth abstractions defined in Story 1.2; do not pick libraries here.

### Testing

- Lighthouse PWA checks: installable, service worker, manifest.
- First-time vs returning user flow e2e.
- Auth happy/edge paths from chat prompts.
