# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Marshanta, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

We will make a conscious decision to avoid a pre-packaged, full-stack starter template. This mitigates the risks of technical debt and over-engineering by allowing us to build the system with only the components we need. The "blank slate" approach will be managed by carefully selecting a core set of technologies and building the project structure from the ground up, ensuring it is simple, organized, and perfectly tailored to Marshanta's needs. We will ensure all selected technologies are compatible and well-documented to prevent unforeseen issues and to enable our AI agents to work effectively.
