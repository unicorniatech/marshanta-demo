# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

**Goal:** Establish the project's technical foundation, user authentication, and basic data models.

**Priority:** High

**Status:** Draft

## Business Value

This epic provides the essential technical foundation for the entire Marshanta platform. It establishes the project structure, authentication system, and core data models that all other features will build upon. Without this foundation, no other functionality can be implemented.

## User Impact

While this epic primarily focuses on technical infrastructure, it directly impacts users by:
- Ensuring their data is securely stored and accessed
- Providing a reliable authentication system
- Creating a consistent project structure that will enable rapid development of user-facing features

## Technical Scope

- Project scaffolding and monorepo setup
- User authentication and authorization system
- Core data models for users, restaurants, and delivery partners
- Database schema design and migration system

## Dependencies

- None (this is the foundational epic)

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the project's monorepo structure and install all core dependencies, so that I have a consistent and organized starting point for development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The project root contains a `package.json` file with monorepo configurations.
- The `apps` directory contains `web` (PWA) and `api` (backend) folders.
- A `packages/shared` folder exists for shared code.
- All core dependencies are installed in their respective `package.json` files.

### Story 1.2: User Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a client, I want to be able to securely register, log in, and log out of the platform, so that my personal data and order history are protected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A registration endpoint is available for new users.
- A login endpoint authenticates users and returns a session token.
- All requests to protected endpoints require a valid session token.
- User data is stored securely in the database.

### Story 1.3: Core Data Models

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the core data models for users and restaurants, so that I can store and manage basic information for the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A `User` data model exists with fields for email, password, and role.
- A `Restaurant` data model exists with fields for name, address, and contact information.
- A `DeliveryPartner` data model exists.
- The database schema is defined and can be migrated.

## Definition of Done

This epic will be considered complete when:
- The monorepo structure is set up and all dependencies are installed
- Users can register, log in, and log out of the system
- Core data models are implemented and can be used by other epics
- All stories have been completed and meet their acceptance criteria
