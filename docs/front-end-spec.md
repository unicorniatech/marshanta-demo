# Marshanta UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Marshanta's user interface. Its primary goal is to serve as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

-   **Primary User Segment:** Tech-savvy individuals and students aged 18 to 26 who are accustomed to modern delivery platforms like Uber Eats.
-   **Secondary User Segment:** Individuals aged 30 to 80 who are not as comfortable with technology and typically place orders by phone.

### Usability Goals

-   **Ease of learning:** New users can complete core tasks within 5 minutes.
-   **Efficiency of use:** Power users can complete frequent tasks with minimal clicks.
-   **Error prevention:** Clear validation and confirmation for destructive actions.
-   **Memorability:** Infrequent users can return without relearning.

### Design Principles

1.  **Clarity over cleverness:** Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation.
2.  **Progressive disclosure:** Show only what's needed, when it's needed.
3.  **Consistent patterns:** Use familiar UI patterns throughout the application.
4.  **Immediate feedback:** Every action should have a clear, immediate response.
5.  **Accessible by default:** Design for all users from the start.
