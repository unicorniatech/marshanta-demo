# MVP Scope

## Core Features (Must Have)

- **Conversational AI Interface for Clients:** A chat-based system that allows users to browse menus, place orders, track deliveries, and make payments. This is essential for the core user experience you envisioned.
- **Restaurant Order and Process Management:** A system for restaurants to accept incoming orders, manage the preparation process, and seamlessly hand off the completed order to a delivery partner. This will include status updates such as "Order Accepted," "Preparing," and "Ready for Pickup."
- **Delivery Partner Workflow Management:** A workflow for delivery drivers to accept an assigned delivery, receive the order details, confirm pickup, and update the delivery status (e.g., "On the Way," "Delivered").
- **Real-time Map-based Tracking:** The ability for clients to track their delivery on a map in real-time. The conversational AI will handle the display of this information and reassure the customer as needed.
- **Restaurant Onboarding and Menu Management:** A simple interface for restaurants to sign up, add their menus, set prices, and manage their availability.
- **Basic Admin Dashboard:** A dashboard for platform administrators to monitor key metrics, manage restaurants, and handle customer support inquiries.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** The ability for clients to pay for their orders securely through the platform.

## Out of Scope for MVP

- **Advanced AI Insights for Admin:** The initial MVP will focus on gathering the data needed for future analysis, but the advanced insights and predictive analytics can be developed in a later phase.
- **Loyalty Programs or Promotions:** These can be added post-launch to encourage customer retention.
- **In-app Chat between Client and Restaurant:** The initial chat will be with Marshanta (the AI). Direct communication between clients and restaurants can be added later.
- **Multiple Delivery Company Integration:** We'll start with a single delivery partner for simplicity and then add more as the business grows.

## MVP Success Criteria

- A fully functional platform that allows clients to place an order and have it delivered by a partner restaurant.
- All core user roles (Client, Restaurant, Delivery Partner, Admin) are supported with essential functionality.
- Data is being collected to inform future business decisions and AI development.
- The order and delivery process for restaurants and delivery partners is reliable and efficient.
- Clients can track their orders in real-time through the conversational interface, providing a sense of transparency and peace of mind.
